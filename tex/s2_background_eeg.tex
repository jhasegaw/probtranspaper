\subsection{Electrophysiology of Speech Perception}

The human auditory system is sensitive to within-category distinctions
in speech sounds, but such pre-categorical perceptual distinctions may
be lost in transcription tasks, where a listener must filter their
percepts through the limited number of categorical representations
available in their native language orthography.  EEG distribution
coding is a proposed new method that interprets the electrical evoked
potentials of an untrained listener (measured by
electroencephalography or EEG) as a probability distribution
over the phone set of the utterance language
(Fig.~\ref{fig:eeg_paradigm}).  A transcriber, in this scenario, listens
to speech in both his native language and an unfamiliar non-native
target language, while his EEG responses are recorded.  From his
responses to English speech, an English-language EEG phone recognizer
is trained~\cite{Liberto15}.  Misperception probabilities
$\rho(\psi|\phi)$ are then estimated: for each non-native phone
$\phi$, the classifier outputs are interpreted as an estimate of
$\rho(\psi|\phi)$.
