\section{Algorithms for Training ASR Using Probabilistic Transcription}

An ASR is a parameterized pmf,
$\pi(x,s|\phi,\theta)$, specifying the dependence of
acoustic features, $x$, and senones, $s$, on the phone transcript
$\phi$ and the parameter vector $\theta$, where the notation
$\pi(\cdot)$ denotes a pmf dependent on ASR parameters.  
Assume a hidden Markov model (HMM), therefore
\[
\pi(x,s|\phi,\theta)=\prod_{\ell=1}^L \prod_{t=1}^T
\pi(s_t^\ell|s_{t-1}^\ell,\phi^\ell,\theta)\pi(x_t^\ell|s_t^\ell,\theta)
\]
