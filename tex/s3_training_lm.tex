\subsection{Using a Language Model During Training}
\label{sec:trainwithlm}

During segmental K-means, it is advantageous to incorporate as much
information as possible about the utterance language.
Define $G$ to be an FST representing the modeled phone bigram
probability
$\pi(\phi^\ell|\theta)=\prod_{m=1}^M\pi(\phi_m^\ell|\phi_{m-1}^\ell,\theta)$.
Training results can be improved by using $H\circ C\circ PT\circ G$ to
compute segmental K-means.

    knowledge-based G2P (center).}
  \label{fig:wikitext}
\end{figure}

By assumption, phone bigram information is not available from speech:
we assume that there is no transcribed speech in the target language.
A reasonable proxy, however, can be constructed from text.
Fig.~\ref{fig:wikitext} shows text data downloaded from Wikipedia in
Swahili, and a segment of a knowledge-based G2P for the Swahili
language.  Because this phone bigram will also be used
in ASR testing, it is constructed using a knowledge-based method
that requires zero test-language training data: The G2P is
constructed by looking up ``Swahili alphabet'' on Wikipedia,
downloading the resulting web page, and converting it by hand into
an unweighted finite state transducer~\cite{Hasegawajohnson15}.  By
passing the former through the latter, it is possible to generate
synthetic phone sequences in the target language.

Composing $PT\circ G$ is complicated by the presence of null
transitions in the PT.  A null transition in the PT matches a
non-event in the language model, for which normal FST notation has no
representation. In order to compose the PT with the language model,
therefore, it is necessary to introduce a special type of
``non-event'' symbol, here denoted ``\#2'', into the language model
(Fig.~\ref{fig:liu1}).  A language
model ``non-event'' is a transition that leaves any state, and returns
to the same state (a self-loop).  Such self-loops, labeled with the
special symbol ``\#2'' on both input and output language, are added to
every state in $G$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:liu1} (b)).
The probabilistic transcript, then, is
augmented with the special symbol ``\#2'' as the output-language symbol
for every null-input edge (input symbol is $\phi_m^\ell =\emptyset$).
