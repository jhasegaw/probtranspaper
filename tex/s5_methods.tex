ASR was trained in four target languages {\color{blue} in topline,
  baseline, and experimental conditions. Training methods are detailed
  in Sec.~\ref{sec:mlbaseline}.  Results are desribed in
  Sec.~\ref{ssec:asr}.}

%transcripts.  Unspoken texts and untranscribed audio were acquired
%in seven languages (Sec.~\ref{sec:data}).  Texts from mismatched
%crowdsourcing were decoded using a multilingual misperception G2P
%(Sec.~\ref{sec:methodsmc}), or using a language-specific misperception
%G2P estimated using EEG (Sec.~\ref{sec:methods_eeg}).  Baseline
%cross-lingual systems were trained using native transcripts from
%six different languages not including the target language
%(Section~\ref{sec:mlbaseline}).  Finally, parameters of the acoustic
%model were adapted using PTs in the target language, derived from
%either self-training or from mismatched transcripts
%(Sec.~\ref{sec:ptadapt}).
