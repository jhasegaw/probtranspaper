%\subsection{Mismatched Crowdsourcing}
\label{sec:methodsmc}

Mismatched transcripts were collected from crowd workers (Turkers)
on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
%for all the data listed in
%Table~\ref{tab:data}.  The crowdsourcing task setup is described
%in~\cite{JHJ15b}.
Each 5-sec speech segment was further split into 4
non-overlapping segments to make the non-native listening task
easier. The crowdsourcing task was set up as described
in~\cite{JHJ15b}; briefly, the segments were played to Turkers,
who transcribed what they heard (typically in the form of nonsense
syllables) using English orthography. Each segment was
transcribed by 10 distinct Turkers. More than 2500 Turkers
participated in these tasks, with roughly 30\% of them claiming to
know only English (Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Chinese were
some of the other languages listed by the Turkers).
