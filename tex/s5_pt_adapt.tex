%\subsection{MAP Adaptation to Probabilistic Transcripts}
\label{sec:ptadapt}

The {\sc PT-adapt} system was
adapted using MAP adaptation (Sec.~\ref{sec:adaptation})
co mputed over weighted finite state transducers in 
Kaldi~\cite{Kaldi2011}. In order to efficiently carry out the required
operations on the cascade $H\circ C\circ PT\circ G$,
the cascade for $PT$ includes an
additional wFST restricting the number of consecutive deletions of
phones and insertions of letters (to a maximum of 3).
MAP adaptation for
the acoustic model was carried out for a number of iterations (12 for
yue \& cmn, 14 for hun \& swh, with a re-alignment stage in iteration
10).
