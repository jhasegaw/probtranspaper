%    Arabic (arb), and Hungarian (hun).  Probabilistic transcripts

%    universal phone set (leftmost bar in each language), using a
%    phone set specific to the target language (middle bar in each
%    language), and using a phonotactic language model derived from
%    Wikipedia texts (rightmost bar in each language).}

The quality of a probabilistic transcript derived from mismatched
crowdsourcing is significantly improved by using a phone language
model during the decoding process ($\rho(\phi)$ in Eq.~(\ref{eq:PT})).
%A crude measure of the quality of the PTs is given by the label phone error
%rate (LPER), which measures the difference
%between $\phi^* = \argmax_{\phi} \rho(\phi|T)$ and a native transcript.
Phone
language models for each target language were computed from Wikipedia
texts using the methods described in Sec.~\ref{sec:trainwithlm}.
Label phone error rate
(LPER) of the 1-best path through the resulting PTs are shown in
Table~\ref{fig:pt_decode_per}, computed with reference to a native
transcript in each language.  As shown, the use of a phone
language model, derived from Wikipedia text, reduces LPER by about 10\%
absolute, in each language.

%\label{tab:LPER}
%\end{table}

%Table~\ref{tab:LPER} lists LPERs on the development and evaluation
%sets, for all seven languages.
LPER of the 1-best path does not
accurately reflect the extent of information in the PTs that can be
leveraged during ASR adaptation.  Consider, for example, the four
Urdu phones~\ipa{[p,p\textsuperscript{h},b,b\textsuperscript{H}]}.  An attentive
English-speaking transcriber must choose between the two letters
$<$p,b$>$ in order to represent any of these four phones.  The
misperception G2P therefore maps the letters $<$p,b$>$ into a
distribution over the phones~\ipa{[p,p\textsuperscript{h},b,b\textsuperscript{H}]}.
There is no reason to expect that the maximizer of
$\rho(\phi|\lambda)$ is correct, but there is good reason to expect
the correct answer to be a member of a short $N$-best list ($N\le 4$
phones/grapheme).  A fuller picture is therefore obtained by
considering a collection of sequences that are almost equally 
probable according to our model. Figure~\ref{fig:listPER}
shows the trend of LPER (for three languages) obtained by
using collections $\phi$ of increasing size, plotted against an
entropy estimate of $\rho(\phi)$, e.g., 1 bit of entropy allows two equally
probable choices for each phone in $\phi$. LPER
rates drop significantly across all languages within 1
bit of entropy per phone, illustrating the extent of information
captured by the PTs.
